Scavenge and Survive gamemode script for SA:MP


A PvP SA:MP server script built upon the SIF framework.

The aim of the game is to find supplies such as tools or weapons to help you
survive, either alone or in a group.

The overall objective is to build a stable community and defend it from hostile
players known as bandits.

Items spawn around the map in various places categorised by type, rarity and
location. Vehicles are rare and spawn with damaged engines, tires or locked,
they will usually spawn with loot inside the trunk.


The gamemode is written in such a way that moving to a completely custom area
would be simple as just changing a few coordinate lines in some files.


I encourage people to play around with this gamemode, create a new map and put
loot spawns in it, I would love to see what is created!



Enjoy, do whatever you want with it, but keep my name on it :)
